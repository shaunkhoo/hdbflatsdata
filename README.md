## Analysing HDB Resale Flats Data from Data.gov.sg

This is the GitHub page for my post analysing Singapore's HDB resale flats transactions data, which you can find [here](https://shaunkhoo.github.io/post/hdbresaleflats1/).

There is only one R script file which you need (Data processing.R), which will work as long as you have the relevant data files in the same working directory in a folder called "Data". You can download all the raw data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1GcDD7hSRfrh4PqZ-YHwh8wLLaEXUfQWs), although all of this is publicly available online on [Data.gov.sg](www.data.gov.sg). I've also included some of the final processed data which I used for my analysis.

Raise an issue on GitHub or drop me a message on LinkedIn if you have any questions about the data or the analysis.
